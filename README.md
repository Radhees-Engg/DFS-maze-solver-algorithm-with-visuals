# DFS Maze Solver (Stack-Based, Visualized with Raylib)
---

This project implements a Depth First Search (DFS) maze solver using an explicit stack, visualized in real time using Raylib.
This project demonstrates true DFS backtracking without recursion.
--- 

## Features

- Stack-based DFS (no recursion)
- Correct backtracking using memory
- Dead-end detection
- Real-time visualization
- Grid-based maze exploration
---

## Dependencies

- C++
- Raylib
---

## Notes

- This is exploration DFS, not shortest-path
- Intended for learning maze traversal and backtracking
- Forms the base for Micromouse and path-planning algorithms
